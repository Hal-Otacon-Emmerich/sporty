# Coding Challenge

Before running make sure that you install all dependecies 

First run `npm i` 

Then run `npm start`

## What i used and why
i used create-react-app to quickly generate app env
i used chatGPT once, to make sure how correctly filter `new Set(leagues.leagues.map(league => league.strSport))` in `Dropdown.js` file.
